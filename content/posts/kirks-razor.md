I've come across this phenomenon a ton in my career and figured I'd finally give it a name: Kirk's Razor.

Kirk's Razor can succinctly be defined as:

> The phenomenon where as soon as you publicly ask for help with a problem it either solves itself or the solution becomes immediately apparent.

While this may be similar to Rubber Duck Debugging, this applies to any problem not just those related to debugging code issues.

*Example Scenarios:*
* After dozens of minutes struggling: "Is anyone else's JIRA running extremely slow today? [Enter]" - then almost immediately you have no more issues with JIRA.
* You've reloaded Slack multiple times because every time you go to a certain channel it starts your scroll at a certain post in the past you've already read. "Is this channel is stuck scrolling wise? Reload isn't fixing it :sob:" And then when you click back to the channel it's fixed itself.
