Hi, I'm Kirk, and I'm a Software Engineer.

I currently work for GE Digital where I work on an AWS-based serverless compliance platform and evangelize Software Engineering best practices throughout the company. We basically act as an independent startup embedded in the enterprise world, helping teach other teams using the software we write to lead by example.  I spend most of my time writing software in NodeJS, Go, or Python and sometimes Ruby, Java, or PHP.

I previously worked at the Rochester Institute of Technology where I did Drupal development as part of University Web Services while I finished my degree in Information Technology part-time.  Before that I worked for the University of Rochester as a front-end web developer.

My main areas of focus are Software Testing, Continuous Integration/Deployment, Operational Maturity, and Serverless Architectures.

When I'm not slinging code or talking about code I'm turning big pieces of wood into smaller pieces of wood and sawdust in my garage.  I might also be training for my next triathlon, or trying to spend as much time outdoors with my two daughters.
