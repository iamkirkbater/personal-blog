Hi, I'm Kirk, and I'm a Software Engineer.

I currently work for Red Hat on the Site Reliability Engineering team.

I previously worked at a Phishing Defense company called Cofense as a Production Engineer, General Electric as a Software Engineer, Rochester Institute of Technology as a Drupal/Front-end developer and the University of Rochester as a front-end web developer.

I currently work with Go, but in the past I've worked with Python, Javascript, PHP, HTML/CSS and have some experience with Java and Ruby.

My main areas of focus are Software Testing, Toil Reduction, Operational Maturity, and Software Architecture.

When I'm not slinging code or talking about code I'm turning big pieces of wood into smaller pieces of wood and sawdust in my garage.  I might also be training for my next triathlon, or trying to spend as much time outdoors with my two daughters.
